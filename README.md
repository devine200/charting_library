This repository contains the TradingView Charting Library package. If you use Git in your project, please feel free to use this repo as a submodule in yours.

The `master` branch contains the most recent features and fixes.

Please read the [documentation][doc-url] and the [Best Practices][best-practices-url] before using the Library.

### Issues Tracking
We use GitHub's [Issues tracker][issues-url] for our project. Feel free to create bug reports and features requests. Make sure to read the documentation before asking questions - this will avoid repeated questions, leaving us more time for developing the library.
